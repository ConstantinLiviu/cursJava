    // I. Project Initialization
        // 1. Create a new directory for the assignment project.
        // 2. Initialize a Git repository in the project directory.

    // II. Working with Branches
        // 1. Create a branch named "feature" (or any other suitable name).
        // 2. Work on this branch and add some relevant files for the project.

    // III. Commits and History of Changes
        // 1. Make some modifications to the files and commit these changes.
        // 2. View the commit history and identify each change made.

    // IV. Resolving Conflicts
        // 1. Simulate a conflict between two branches.
        // 2. Intentionally make changes to the same file in both branches and try to integrate it into the main (master) branch by resolving conflicts.

    // V. Collaboration via GitHub
        // 1. Create an empty repository on GitHub and connect it to the local repository.
        // 2. Push the branches and commits to GitHub.
        // 3. Simulate collaboration between two or more students, where each makes a change in their own branch and submits a pull request to merge the changes into the main branch.

    // VI. Managing Branches and Cleaning the Repository
        // 1. Try managing local branches and deleting them once the changes are integrated.
        // 2. Clean up the repository's history to keep it organized and easy to track.
        // Disregarded #2 - kept history in order to allow the rest of the challenges to be reviewed

    // Use the IntelliJ graphical interface to view history, make commits, and manage branches.
