        // 1. Displaying Today's Date
        // Description: Write a method named displayTodaysDate that, when called, prints the current date to the
        // console.
        // Expected Output: Today's date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

        // 2. Date Decomposition
        // Description: Write a method named displayDateComponents that accepts a date as an argument and prints its
        // year, month, and day components separately.
        // Input: A date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
        // Expected Output:
        // makefile
        // Copy code
        // Year: YYYY
        // Month: MM
        // Day: DD

        // 3. Create a Specific Date
        // Description: Write a method named createSpecificDate that returns a date object representing 19th August
        // 2025.
        // Expected Output: A date object for 2025-8-19.

        // 4. Comparing User-Entered Dates
        // Description: Write a method named areDatesEqual that reads two dates from the console and returns true if
        // they are equal, and false otherwise.
        // Input: Two dates entered by the user in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
        // Expected Output:
        // true if both dates are equal.
        // false if they are different.

        // 5. Is Today a Specific Date?
        // Description: Write a method named isTodaySpecificDate that checks if today's date is 10th December 2019.
        // Expected Output:
        // true if today's date is 2019-12-10.
        // false otherwise.


        // 6. Getting Current Time
        // Description: Write a method named displayCurrentTime that prints the current time to the console.
        // Expected Output: The current time in the format HH:MM:SS.

        // 7. Date Arithmetic
        // Description: Write a method named addWeeksToToday that accepts an integer as its argument. This integer
        // denotes the number of weeks. The method should add this number of weeks to today's date and return the
        // resultant date.
        // Input: An integer n (e.g., 4).
        // Expected Output: A date object that is n weeks from today.

        // 8. Weekday Identifier
        // Description: Construct a method named findDayOfWeek that takes in a date and returns the specific day of
        // the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for that date.
        // Input: A date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
        // Expected Output: The day of the week in string format (e.g., "Wednesday").

        // 9. Interval Between Dates
        // Description: Design a method titled daysBetween that reads two dates from the console and computes the
        // total number of days between them.
        // Input: Two dates given by the user in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
        // Expected Output: An integer showcasing the difference in days between the two dates.

        // 10. Date Authenticator
        // Description: Engineer a method named isValidDate that captures a date string from the console and assesses
        // if it conforms to a valid date format (YYYY-MM-DD). The method should also consider leap years when
        // validating February dates.
        // Input: A string of a date from the console.
        // Expected Output:
        // true if the input adheres to the date format and denotes a genuine date.
        // false if otherwise.

        // 11. Duration Since
        // Description: Construct a method dubbed elapsedTimeSince that ingests a prior time (in the HH:MM:SS format)
        // as its input and displays the time duration from that moment to the present.
        // Input: A time given in the format HH:MM:SS.
        // Expected Output: The time span given as X hours, Y minutes, Z seconds.

        // 12. Time Conversion Across Zones
        // Description: Develop a method named convertToTimeZone that collects a date and time from the console in the
        // pattern YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS and a timezone (like "EST", "PST"). The objective is to transmute the specified
        // date and time to align with the provided timezone and then showcase the result.
        // Input:
        // Date and time structured as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
        // A string indicating the timezone (e.g., "EST").
        // Expected Output: The recalibrated date and time synchronized with the inputted timezone.
