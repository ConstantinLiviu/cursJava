        // 1. College Management System -  Design a system for a college to efficiently manage information about
        // students, professors, and courses:
        // Store comprehensive profiles for every student, capturing their first name, last name, sex, age, date of
        // birth, CNP, and address.
        // Similarly, maintain detailed profiles for every professor, including their first name, last name,
        // sex, age, date of birth, CNP, and address.
        // The college offers eight distinct courses: Math, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, Biology,
        // Geography, English, and History. For each course, track details like its schedule, duration, description
        // and the assigned professor.
        // Allow for the assignment of a professor to a specific course and ensure the ability to retrieve and
        // view course details, including its assigned professor.

        // Note: Think about the needed classes, attributes and methods. We should master OOP principles and
        // always find a way to transpose the objects from real life (or the business domain) to our application,
        // with Java code.
        // We should also know to explain the technical decisions we made.

        // 2. School Gradebook  - Develop a gradebook system for a school where teachers can:
        // Add students to their classes.
        // Each student has a name and a unique student ID.
        // Assign grades for assignments or exams to each student.
        // Calculate the average grade for each student in their class.
        // View a list of all students and their respective average grades.

        // 3. Simple Banking Application - Construct a banking system that lets account holders:
        // Create an account with personal details and an initial deposit.
        // Deposit and withdraw money from their account.
        // Check their current balance.
        // View a summary of their recent transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and balance after
        // each transaction.

        // 4. Fitness Tracking System - Design a system for individuals who want to track their fitness activities:
        // Users can log different types of workouts, such as running, weightlifting, or yoga.
        // Each workout type has specific attributes like duration, distance, or weight lifted.
        // Users can set weekly fitness goals, like running a certain number of kilometers or lifting a specific total
        // weight.
        // Generate a summary at the end of the week, showing all logged workouts and indicating if the user met their
        // goals.
        // Allow users to search and view their past workouts based on the type of activity or date.
